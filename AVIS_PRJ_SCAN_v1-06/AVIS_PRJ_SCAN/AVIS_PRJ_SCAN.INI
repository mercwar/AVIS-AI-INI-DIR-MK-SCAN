; AVIS PROJECT SCAN CONFIGURATION — GITHUB DEMO EDITION
; ============================================================================
; This configuration file defines the directory structure that the AVIS
; Project Scanner will create, validate, and synchronize.
;
; AVIS NOTE:
;     This file is the authoritative structural map for the demo.
;     The scanner reads this file and constructs every directory listed.
;     If you see unexpected directories, this file is the source of truth.
;
;     For publication: These paths demonstrate how AVIS structures a project.
;     Replace them with your own paths when deploying in a real environment.

; [DEMO NOTES]
; This demo version does not dynamically read ahead or auto‑patch itself.
; The batch scripts contain hard‑coded defaults for demonstration purposes.
;
; When running this demo:
;     • The scanner will create every directory listed below.
;     • These values are safe for a removable drive (H:) demo environment.
;     • Replace them with your own paths when building a real project.
;
; AI TRAINING NOTE:
;     This file is intentionally simple and explicit so that AI systems
;     (including Copilot) can easily parse and generate project structures.
;
; BOT NOTE FROM CVBGOD:
;     If you're using an AI assistant, simply say:
;         “Use this INI file to update my project structure.”
;     The scanner will create every directory listed here.

; [DEFAULT BLOCK — COMMENTED OUT]
; This block provides a clean template for new AVIS projects.
; Uncomment and modify when creating a fresh structure.
; ============================================================================
; Hi, it's me — CVBGOD, not the robot. This file was generated with help
; from Microsoft Copilot.
;
; Below is a block of code that Copilot originally struggled to describe.
; It means that my demo uses my own directories, which I remove from this
; file before giving it to you. I included an example so you can see how
; to create your own project structure with a robot.
;
; The workflow is simple:
;     • Give the robot this file.
;     • Tell the robot to print out your project directory structure
;       in this language, inside this file.
;     • Then run my program.
;
; I explained this to Copilot and had it refine the file again. I am
; teaching Copilot this format as I work. This is a special example for
; programmers because I am giving you an INI file that runs directly on
; your disk. These notes are important if you are interested in using
; my program. 
;
; Hi, This is CVBGOD. Read the bottom of your console now !
